# 100daysOf-JavaScript

# Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment
### *I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*
### *From 9pm to 10pm every day

#### Start Date
June 25th, 2016. [PUT YOUR DATE HERE]

## Additional Rules
1. I will plan my task for the day in the 10day log.md file
2. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode #JavaScript
3. If I code at work and school, that time won't count towards the challenge.
4. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
5. I will update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
6. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge. (If you've just started learning to code, read [FAQ](FAQ.md))



## Ideas to make this challenge more effective
1. To increase the chances of my success, it's a requirement that I add a link to each of the day posts in the [log](log.md). It can be a link to a commit on GitHub, a link to a blog post
2. If I get upset or stuck, read this article: [Learning to Code: When It Gets Dark](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learning-to-code-when-it-gets-dark-e485edfb58fd/)
3. If I don't know why there is such an emphasis on working on the projects vs doing tutorials or online courses, read this: [How to Get a Developer Job in Less Than a Year](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-get-a-developer-job-in-less-than-a-year-c27bbfe71645/)
4. If I can't push my code to GitHub for some reason (e.g. if I'm only starting to code and doing interactive exercises), provide a link to a tweet. Or something else as long as my challenge stays public - and I get the benefit of being committed to it and accountable for my progress.
