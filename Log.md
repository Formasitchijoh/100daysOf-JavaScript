#### I am not a beginner in JavaScript or programming, I know the basics but I am just too lazy to start up a project or stick to one thing that is why I want to stick with JavaScript for the next 100days and overcome my fears 
# Day 1
 ### I am building a color picker using JavaScript 
   It enables users to change the color on the screen on clicking a button 
# Day 2
 I am building a timer project with the possibility to increase, decrease and reset the timer.The concepts learned will be
   + document.querySelectorAll()
   + forEach()
   + addEventListener()
   + currentTarget property
   + classList
   + textContent
